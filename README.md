# myElements.jquery

A jQuery interface that allows any HTML element to behave **optimistically** and aware of **offline state**, **backend messages**, **backend data updates** and **URL route updates**.

**myelements.jquery** allows you to bind an HTML element to backend events and 
consume them like you [consume any jQuery event](http://api.jquery.com/on/). Useful if you love doing things the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) way and you like [express](http://expressjs.com/) apps empowered with [socket.io](http://socket.io/) .

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install myelements.jquery
```
   
### Requirements

**myelements** works within this client/server environment: 

* Any HTML5 compatible browser with jQuery loaded.
* A **NodeJS** `express()`  app as a backend and a **socket.io** instance attached to the server the express app uses. 

## Features

**Backend events as jQuery events**: You can `trigger()` an event in the backend
and it will be forwarded to every element that has been applied `$().myelement()` so you can
listen to the event like `$("#el").on("customEvent")`;

**History API PushState reactiveness**: You can make any HTML Element react 
to `.on("page")` event that triggers when the URL matches anything you want.

**Templates**: The element innerHTML is taken as a EJS template. You declare
which message will be the template scope. So, when a message arrives from the backend
the template is re-rendered.

**Templatest scope**: Elements can declare to be binded
 to messages data object that arrives  from the server.

**Offline data synchronization**: Every message received from the backend
is stored in browser storage. So the element can re-render its templates basing
its scope on a local copy of the last state of the data stored in localstorage
automatically by **myelements.jquery** on every message.

## Usage
 
**Sending messages in the backend**
    
    var frontend = myelements(app, server);

    frontend.io.on("connection", function(client) {
      client.trigger("lastTweets", [{
        text: "Hi"
      }, {
        text: "Hello"
      }]);
    });

**Receiving messages from the backend**

    $("#el").myelement();
    $("#el").on("lastTweets", function(event, data) {
      console.log(data);
    });


**Sending messages in the frontend**

    $("#el").send("newMessage", {greeting:"Hi!"});


**Receiving messages from the frontend**

    client.on.message("lastTweets", function(data) {
      data.foreach(function(val,i) {
        console.log("Item %s is %s", i, val);
      });
    });


## Client API

The client part of **myelements** is jQuery events mainly. 


### $(selector).myelement(options)
 
 Initializes HTML elements in order to receive the jQuery events provided by **myelements**.

__Arguments__
* `selector` -  A regular [jQuery selector](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/).
* `options`
  * `templateScope` -  A message name . When the frontend receives this message from the backend, the element's `innerHTML` will be interpreted as an EJS template and re-rendered with the event's data as a property of the `locals` object.

_You may want to alter some of the default parameters for the underlying  **socket.io-client** instance with [pre-initialization options](#pre-initialization-options)_.

### $(selector).send(event_name, data)

Sends a message to the backend. 

__Arguments__

* `selector` -  A jQuery selector for elements previously instantiated with `.myelement()`.
* `name` -  A message name . The message is sent via socket.io's `send()` method. As such it need an event name.
* `data` -  An `Object`, `Array` or `String` to send to the backend as payload data.

### $(selector).on(event_name, callback)

Listen for events on the element. When **myelements** receives a socket.io's message from the backend it triggers it 
on every element that has been initialized with the `myelement()` method.

__Arguments__
* `selector` -  A jQuery selector for elements previously instantiated with `.myelement()`.
* `event_name` -  A message, event name . The message is sent in the backend via socket.io's `send()` method. As such you specify here an event name to match.
* `callback(jQueryEvent, event_data)` -  A function to be called when the message arrives. `event_data` is the emitted data with the event.

### Pre-initialization options

You may want to alter some of the default parameters used by **socket.io** setting `window.myelementsOptions`
prior to loading **myelements.jquery**.

* `window.myelementsOptions` -  Set this object before the `<script>` tag that loads `myelements.jquery.js`.
  * `socketHost` -  Host or host:port for the backend. **Default**: `undefined`.
  * `socketNamespace` -  socket.io namespace used by myelements. **Default**: `"/myelements"`.
  * `socketPath` -  socket.io HTTP URL used by meyelements socket.io `io.Manager` instance **Default**: `"/socket.io"`.

**Example**

    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.myelementsOptions = {...};
    </script>
    <script src = "/myelements/myelements.jquery.js"></script>

### Element Events

Calling the `.myelement()` method (jquery) on an element makes the element reactive to new events provided by the **myelements** library. You listen to them like

```js
$("#el").on("disconnect", function() {
  $(this).html("We cannot reach the backend now").fadeOut().fadeIn();
});
```

* `offline` -  Fired upon inability from the agent (browser or web view in phonegap) to detect Internet conectivity. *Compatibility note:* This event does not work as excepted in Firefox. Firefox fires it only when the user chooses `Work offline` mode.
* `online` -  Fired when the agent is able to reach the Internet.
* `disconnect` -  Fired upon a disconnection from backend. _Event mapped directly from socket-io client_.
* `reconnect` - Fired upon a successful connection to the backend. _Event mapped directly from socket-io client_.
* `reconnecting` - Fired upon an attempt to reconnect to the backend. _Event mapped directly from socket-io client_.
* `reconnect_error` - Fired upon a backend reconnection attempt error. _Event mapped directly from socket-io client_.
* `reconnect_failed` - Fired when couldnâ€™t reconnect to the backend after trying a lot of times. _Event mapped directly from socket-io client_.
* `connect` - Fired on send socket connect events. _Event mapped directly from socket-io client_.
* `route` -  Fired on each element, when the URL path changes. *Compatibility note:* This event is fired only in browsers that support the [history.pushState API](http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html).
* `init` -  Fired on element initialization. Useful for extending `myelements` reactions on events.


## Backend API

### myelements(app, server, options)

__Arguments__

* `app` __(required)__ - Express app.
* `server` __(required)__ -  http/https/spdy server
* `options` (optional)
  * `sockets` -  A previously instantianted `io.Server` instance in order for reuse it instead of using the one created internally by **myelements**. **Default:** `undefined`.
  * `socketNamespace` - Default socket.io namespace used by myelements. **Default:** `"/myelements"`.
  * `socketPath` - HTTP path on which to mount socket.io. **Default:** `"/socket.io"`.
  * `session` - A middleware to use as session handler. **Default:** `undefined`.

**Returns**

* `{Object}`
  * `io` - A socket.io `io.Server` instance.

**Example**

    var myelements = require("myelements");
    var frontend = myelements(app, server):

    frontend.io.on("connection", function(socket) {
      socket.trigger("greeting", "Nemo");
    });


### Backend Events

**myelements** emits events via `socket.io` on the socket.io server and on connected sockets.

* `connection` -  Fired on the object returned by myelements().io. This is the standard `connection` event fired by `socket.io` server.<br>**Example:**
     
        var frontend = require("myelements")(app, server):     
        
        frontend.io.on("myelements:connection", function(client) {
          console.log("myelements client connected");
        });

### Backend Methods

_These methods apply to the `socket` object you get when listening the `connection`
event emitted on the socket.io server instance used by **myelements**_. 

My elements adds three methods to a regular socket.io socket instance. 
These methods are just added for convenience because every message sent between
the frontend and the backend is done via socket.io's `send()` method. 

* `socket.trigger()`. Identical to `socket.send()`.
* `socket.broadcast.trigger()`. Identical to `socket.broadcast.send()`.
* `socket.on.message()`. Convenience method for listening just for messages.

#### socket.trigger(event, data)

Used to trigger messages on HTML elements in the frontend.

**Arguments**

* `event` - An event name.
* `data` - An `Array`, `String`, or `Object` to send as message data.


#### socket.on.message(event, callback)

Used to listen for jQuery events thrown by an HTML element in the frontend with the jQuery `trigger()` method.

#### socket.broadcast.trigger(event, data)

Idem to `socket.io`'s client `.broadcast.emit()` trigger an event on every frontend
connected to the server except this socket emitting the broadcast.

* `event` - An event name.
* `data` - An `Array`, `String`, or `Object` to send as message data.


## Example

**In the backend**. An `index.js` for example:

```js
// Standard express app usage 
// attached to a user-created http.Server
var express = require("express"),
  app = express(),
  server = require("http").createServer(app),
  myelements = require("myelements.jquery");

// myelements attaching.
myelements(app, server);
// A simple express way to load a static index.html
app.use(express.static(__dirname));

server.listen(3000);
```

**In the browser**. 

When you attach **myelements** to your express app in the backend, it sets the route `/myelements/myelements.jquery.js` 
with the required client (browser) source. And you can add it to your HTML like this.



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>JS Bin</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- We will improve this element calling $("#el").myelement() -->
  <div id="el">
    This <code>div</code> responds to offline/online events.
  </div>
  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
  <script src = "/myelements/myelements.jquery.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Make the element reactive to new events
    $("#el").myelement()
      // React to offline event
      .on("offline", function() {
     $(this).html("Can't reach the Internet!!!");
      // React to offline event
    }).on("online", function() {
      $(this).html("We're back online");
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```



### Rationale


**myelements.jquery** relies on [socket.io](http://socket.io/) in order to be 
aware of backend events like messages, data updates, etc.

This library is based on thoughts after watching [The 7 Principles of rich web applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2F-128e3sI) by [rauchg](https://github.com/rauchg).
*There's also an [essay](http://rauchg.com/2014/7-principles-of-rich-web-applications/) written about this subjects*. 

After watching that talk I thought about this expected behaviour from a Single Page Application applied to a single HTML element instead of a whole app.

The principles stated there are:

1. **Allow to get content in a single hop.**
2. **React inmediatelly to user input**. Mask latency. Layout adaptation
3. **Making of all our UIs** or the application **eventually consistent**.
   Immediate file representation. (e.g. on Cloudup uploads).
4. **Fine grain control of how we send data back and forth from the app to
   the server**. Automatic retrying when the servers goes down. Detecting
   session invalidation. Handle 403s gracefully.
5. **Enhancing history support**. Fast-back->We can cache the representatoin
   of the latest page so wen we go back, we render it inmediately.
   Scrollback memory. Remembering scrolling position.
6. **Code updates**. (e.g. using the page visibility API to refresh the page on user's behalf).
   Tell the server wich code state (frontend version) is sending data.
7. **The idea of predictive behaviours**. Try to guess what the user is gonna do.
   Mouse direction, preload on hover or on mousedown (old gmail's way).

**Consequences from attaching to the principles.**

The frontend needs to be able to handle a variety of scenarios:
* Session expiration
* User login change
* Very large data deltas (eg: newsfeeds) (Don't make your frontend always relay on a complete event log of changes).


**Consequences from avoiding the principles:**

* We disabled scraping.
* We broke the back button.

 ** About the real time concept.**

* 14kb takes xxx milliseconds.
* 1seconds is the end of realtime perception.
* 0.1 second is the threshold in which the user no longer feels is
   interacting with the data.
